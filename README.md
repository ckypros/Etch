# Etch

- This was a project I created to essentially practice some web development.  
- It performs like a etch a sketch, wherever your cursor goes, it draws on the grid in a continuous line, by changing the color the grid squares.
- `Clear grid` resets the colored squares
- `New Grid` prompts user for a size of a new square grid, such as 16, 32, 50, 100 etc...
